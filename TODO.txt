Questions:
- the book should do the filtering - otherwise a lot of functions will be duplicated in 
reports using the data
- factory or so for reports - all things are the same except the data they display

TODO:
- create desired reports
- save data to permanent file, read/write on application open/close
- get data from invoices, load lists
- visual display
- editing
- error checking and such

report on yields - yields, sales by item, sales by customer
	summary spreadsheet
	sheet for yields - each item, total yield
		get from garen - each item, total planted
		ratio and/or %
	sheet for sales by item - 
		get all sales from load lists
		get from wholesale invoices
		report by item
	sales by customer
		process in above step, sales by customer

NOTES:
It's frustrating to have to work online, since sometimes the internet goes down. 
Pshhh. I'm writing an app Right now. Esp since I can do it really fast having done the one at Riverdog.
