Questions:
- does the book do the filtering? or is that another layer between the book and the displays, where "book"
simply means "database"?
- I expect transaction will need to be clarified more... what fields it has, whether it has an interface and/or inheritance
- note that there is a dispose_on_close option for jframes that aren't the main window

TODO:
- get data, perhaps by implementing a transaction reader for load lists, invoices, csv
- save data to permanent file, read/write on application open/close
- create desired reports
- visual display
- editing
- error checking and such

report on yields - yields, sales by item, sales by customer
	summary spreadsheet
	sheet for yields - each item, total yield
		get from garen - each item, total planted
		ratio and/or %
	sheet for sales by item - 
		get all sales from load lists
		get from wholesale invoices
		report by item
	sales by customer
		process in above step, sales by customer

NOTES:
It's frustrating to have to work online, since sometimes the internet goes down. 
Pshhh. I'm writing an app Right now. Esp since I can do it really fast having done the one at Riverdog.
