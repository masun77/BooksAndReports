Questions and ideas:
- the book should do the filtering - otherwise a lot of functions will be duplicated in 
reports using the data
- factory or so for reports - all things are the same except the data they display. 
Or maybe think of reports more like one screen from which you can add various filters? 
but you can also only ever display by 2 groupings at once - I mean, in a table, you can either show money per customers x time, 
or money customers x item... not money per customer per item... can you? might that be better shown in a chart? 

TODO:
- create desired reports
- save data to permanent file, read/write on application open/close
- get data from invoices, load lists, manually entered (single, invoice, load list); button for csv import
- visual display
- editing of transactions
- error checking and such

report on yields - yields, sales by item, sales by customer
	summary spreadsheet
	sheet for yields - each item, total yield
		get from garen - each item, total planted
		ratio and/or %
	sheet for sales by item - 
		get all sales from load lists
		get from wholesale invoices
		report by item
	sales by customer
		process in above step, sales by customer

NOTES:
It's frustrating to have to work online, since sometimes the internet goes down. 
Pshhh. I'm writing an app Right now. Esp since I can do it really fast having done the one at Riverdog.
