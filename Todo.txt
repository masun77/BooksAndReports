Questions:
- does the book do the filtering? or is that another layer between the book and the displays, where "book"
simply means "database"?
- I expect transaction will need to be clarified more... what fields it has, whether it has an interface and/or inheritance
- note that there is a dispose_on_close option for jframes that aren't the main window

TODO:
- get data, perhaps by implementing a transaction reader for load lists, invoices, csv
- save data to permanent file, read/write on application open/close
- create desired reports
